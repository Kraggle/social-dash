# Laravel Cashier Examples

![Laravel Cashier Examples image](/public/img/laravel-cashier-examples.png)

The [Laravel Docs](https://laravel.com/docs) are great... But, there are a few things that seemed to be missing in the [Laravel Cashier Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/billing), such as basic examples of how to submit the payment form in order to capture payment on the other end. Don't get me wrong, the docs are still amazing, but I wanted to create these examples that anyone can download and easily view a working version of [Cashier](https://github.com/laravel/cashier).

This repo contains 2 examples of accepting payments:

1. Accepting Payment Up Front on the Register Page **master** branch
2. Accepting Payment for the currently logged in user **example2** branch.

## Installation

The install instructions are the same for both examples. After installing you can switch between the 2 branches to test each example. These install instructions assume that you are using Laravel Valet or a similar Laravel local server:

### 1. Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/tnylea/laravel-cashier-examples.git
```

### 2. Change directories and install dependencies

```
cd laravel-cashier-examples
composer install
```

### 3. Add your database  & stripe credentials

Next, copy or rename `.env.example` to `.env`. Then you'll need to **create a new database** and add your database credentials to the `.env` file.:

```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=laravel-cashier-examples
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

We also want to add our Stripe API keys. Head on over to [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) dashboard, and under the **Developer->API Keys** section you'll find your `Publishable key` and your `Secret key`:

Add these keys to the bottom of your .env file:

```
# Test Keys
STRIPE_KEY=pk_test_RKDJpn1L9eRdJOBF3WfaLKRR00VbHCT6ju
STRIPE_SECRET=sk_test_SomeReallyL0ngRand0m5tring...
```

### 4. Create a new Stripe Product

When a user enters their Credit Card Info, they are signing up for your `product` and Stripe needs to know a bit about your product, so we need to create a new product inside of Stripe.

Inside your stripe dashboard, go to **Billing->Products**, and click to Add a `New` product:

![products page image](/public/img/products.png)

For this example, I will give my a product a name of `Laravel Cashier Example`, and click **Create Product**:

Next, we need to create a Pricing Plan for our product. We can add as many Pricing plans to a product as we would like, but in this example we will just add one pricing plan called `starter`, this will be the plan **ID**:

![pricing page image](/public/img/pricing.png)

Then click on **Add pricing plan**, and we've just created our first pricing plan ðŸ™Œ


### 5. Run The Database Migrations

```
php artisan migrate
```

### 6. Test it out ðŸ¤™ You're now accepting payments ðŸ’³

#### Example 1 Test

For **example1** (master), you can visit your app `/register` route and you will see the Credit Card field:

![register page image](/public/img/register.png)

Try signing up with the following credentials to test it out:

```
Credit Card Number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
Expires: 04/24
CVC Code: 242
Zip: 42424
```

And after signing up, you will be redirected to your application dashboard:

![dashboard image](/public/img/dashboard.png)

There will now be a new user in your database. You will also see a new entry in the `subscriptions` table:

![database image](/public/img/subscription.png)

Additionally, if you login to your stripe dashboard you will see that you now have a new customer.

ðŸ”® Magic!

#### Example 2 Test

Make sure to checkout the `example2` branch to "Checkout" this example:

In example2 the user can register for an account without adding a credit card at signup. Register for an account and you will see a Credit Card Input on the dashboard:

![example 2 dashboard image](/public/img/example2-dashboard.png)

You'll see that on the dashboard there is also a message stating that you are not subscribed to any plan. 

Try entering the following Credit Card info and subscribing:

```
Credit Card Number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
Expires: 04/24
CVC Code: 242
Zip: 42424
```

Upon entering the credit card info and clicking the **Subscribe** button, you will be redirected back to the dashboard showing a message that you are a subscribed customer ðŸ¤Ÿ

![dashboard subscribed image](/public/img/subscribed.png)

You will also see a new entry in the `subscriptions` table of your application, and you'll see a new customer in your Stripe Dashboard.

ðŸ‘» Scary Awesome!
